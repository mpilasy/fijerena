## ⚙️ Configuration

### Buffer Settings (Developer)
Default buffer profiles can be adjusted in `PlayerConfigFactory.kt`:

```kotlin
// Live TV (fast zapping)
minBufferMs = 2000
maxBufferMs = 5000
bufferForPlaybackMs = 250
bufferForPlaybackAfterRebufferMs = 500

// VOD (smooth playback)
minBufferMs = 15000
maxBufferMs = 50000
bufferForPlaybackMs = 2500
bufferForPlaybackAfterRebufferMs = 5000
```

### Custom Headers (Developer)
Pass headers when creating PlayerMetadata:

```kotlin
val metadata = PlayerMetadata(
    title = "Stream Name",
    channelName = "IPTV Provider",
    streamUrl = "https://...",
    isLive = true,
    headers = mapOf(
        "Authorization" to "Bearer token",
        "User-Agent" to "CustomPlayer/1.0"
    )
)
```

## 🎨 Phase 4: UX & Navigation Improvements

### Streamlined Authentication Flow
**Impact: Eliminated login screen flash, simplified first-time setup**

**Key Changes:**
- **Removed Login Screen Completely**
  - No more login page flashing on app startup
  - Direct navigation to Settings if no provider configured
  - Direct navigation to ContentTypeSelection if provider exists

- **Auto-Session Restore**
  - Automatically restores session from stored credentials on startup
  - Seamless experience for returning users
  - Silently handles authentication in background

- **Settings as Entry Point**
  - Settings screen now serves as configuration hub
  - Users enter provider URL and credentials directly in Settings
  - Automatic authentication after provider configuration
  - Logout clears session but stays on Settings screen

**User Flow:**
- **First Launch**: App → Settings → Enter provider → Auto-authenticate → ContentTypeSelection
- **Subsequent Launches**: App → Auto-restore session → ContentTypeSelection
- **No More Login Screen**: Completely removed from navigation flow

### VOD Channel Switching Disabled
**Impact: Prevents accidental stream switching during movie/TV show playback**

**Key Features:**
- **Live TV Only**: D-pad up/down channel switching only works for Live TV
- **VOD Protection**: D-pad up/down does nothing during Movies/TV Shows playback
- **Content-Type Aware**: Automatically detects content type (Live TV vs VOD)
- **Intentional Design**: VOD playback requires explicit stream selection

**Technical Details:**
- Checks `currentMetadata.isLive` before allowing channel switching
- PlayerScreen.kt lines 173-196 updated with content type check
- Prevents accidental exits from movies/episodes

### Stats Overlay Improvements
**Impact: Non-intrusive developer metrics on category screens**

**Key Features:**
- **Non-Focusable on Category Screens**: Stats overlay cannot receive focus or be navigated to
- **Interactive on Player Screen**: Full D-pad movement and focus management during playback
- **Separate Implementations**:
  - **Category Screens**: Plain Box, no onClick, completely non-interactive
  - **Player Screens**: Surface with onClick, focusable, movable with D-pad
- **Visual Distinction**: Gray border on category screens, green border when focused on player

**Technical Details:**
- `StatsOverlay` component now has `interactive` parameter
- Uses `Box` instead of `Surface` when `interactive = false`
- CategoryGridScreen passes `interactive = false`
- PlayerScreen uses default `interactive = true`

### Files Modified

**Phase 4 Changes:**
- `TvNavHost.kt` - Removed Login screen, added auto-session restore
- `AuthViewModel.kt` - Kept minimal, session management only
- `PlayerScreen.kt` - Added content type check for channel switching
- `StatsOverlay.kt` - Added interactive parameter, dual implementation
- `CategoryGridScreen.kt` - Pass interactive = false to stats overlay

- TV `CinemaColors.kt` and mobile `Color.kt` re-export as computed `get()` properties
- Zero screen-file changes needed for theme support

**Files Created:**

- `core/navigation/.../Screen.kt` — Added ProviderSelection, AddProvider destinations
- TV and mobile NavHost — Provider routes, startup logic
- TV and mobile `SettingsScreen.kt` — Removed old edit dialog, added "Manage Providers" button

---

### Mobile Login Screen Removal
**Impact: Unified startup flow across TV and mobile**

- Removed `composable<Screen.Login>` route from MobileNavHost
- Mobile now uses same startup logic as TV: check stored credentials → ContentTypeSelection or Settings
- Auto-session restore via `LaunchedEffect` on startup
- No more login screen flash on mobile app launch
- Logout navigates to Settings (not Login) on both platforms

---

### Mobile Player Buffer Fix
**Impact: Fixed Live TV playback failures on mobile**

- Added `setContentType()` call to MobilePlayerScreen (was missing, TV had it)
- Without this, Live TV streams used VOD buffer settings (15s min buffer) causing timeouts
- Now properly configures LIVE_TV profile (2s min buffer, 250ms startup) for live streams

---
